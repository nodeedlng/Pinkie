                        <p>Arquebuses were long barrelled firearms which fired lead balls at the enemy. Relatively slow to reload and cumbersome to use, these men were often used with pikemen nearby for protection. Each time an arquebus was fired, they required a reloading process which would take both hands to accomplish, leaving them vulnerable to charges. The reloading process involved pouring the gunpowder in the barrel and packing it in tightly with a rod then stuffing in a piece of paper to hold it in place. Next the lead ball would be dropped into the barrel and rammed in with the rod. Finally, finer gunpowder would be poured into the pan and the glowing match placed in the serpentine.</p>

                        <p>Their contribution to battles of their time is undeniable. Apart from being able to pierce armour at certain distances, firing an arquebus generated a lot of noise and smoke which could disorient and scare the opposition if unused to seeing them on the battlefield.</p>

                        <p>Men who used the arquebus were called arquebusiers. (How to describe their dress?). Additionally, they wore a flask to hold gunpowder at their hip which they had to take care to not set alight by accident. (By the battle of Pinkie, did most of them use bandoliers instead?)</p>

                        <p>At the battle of Pinkie, the Scots are said to not have any arquebusiers while the English had hired mercenaries to do the job.</p>

                        <p>Inspired by classical armies of old, these pike armed men were the defensive backbone of the renaissance army. In their closely packed square formations, their job was to protect the vulnerable ranged units from enemy cavalry and infantry attacks. </p>

                        <p>Due to the unwieldy size of the weapon, units had to be trained to use them effectively and to keep formation. Part of the power of the pikes lay in the tight formations which gave them a lot of combined mass. </p>

                        <p>Popularised in the continent, the Scottish armies had adopted these weapons as the primary infantry weapon for some time while the English still preferred using the bill over the pike. However, the benefits of the pike were slowly being acknowledged by the English who, by the time of the battle of Pinkie, also incorporated pikes into their ranks.</p>

                        <p>These men were of a higher rank in society who were trained to fight. They were armoured to the highest standards of the day, wearing plate armour over mail. (Did they also have a gambeson underneath?). This armour protected them from most weapons of the time and incapacitating a fully armoured combatant required blunt force or attacking the joints in the armour. The horses were also armoured to a significant degree.</p>

                        <p>When attacking, these men used wooden lances on the charge to break enemy lines. These lances were meant to break on use and be discarded. When in close quarters, the men-at-arms would switch over to their secondary weapon like a sword.</p>

                        <p>As the name suggests, these units were the lighter version of the men-at-arms. Instead of man and horse being fully covered in armour, light horses did not wear armour and their riders only wore three-quarter armour. This marked the point where full body armour was in decline in favour of only armouring vital areas. </p>

                        <p>Like the heavy horse, the light horse fought with lances and a secondary weapon when that broke. Essentially, the light horse were like budget heavy horse and were often used the same way.</p>

                        <p>The culverin was a form of artillery used from the 15th century onwards. It was one type of artillery which was used at the battle of Pinkie. However, all artillery used shared the purpose of killing at extreme range.</p>

                        <p>These artillery pieces were so heavy that they were mounted on a cart and pulled by horses or oxen during transportation. Furthermore, they required a large number of cannonballs and gunpowder which all had to be transported as well. But when deployed, they could whittle down the opposing army’s numbers and drop their morale greatly.</p>

                        <p>The Irish archers did not come from Ireland, but rather from the western isles of Scotland. They, however, fought in Ireland as mercenaries for local lords. The Irish archers were also known as the galloglass who, by the time of the 16th century, had become renowned as a fighting force who rather die than surrender. </p>

                        <p>These men were armed with bows but were no pushover in a melee fight. They often used two handed axes or claymores in close combat and knew how to use their weapons. As for armour, the Irish archers are often depicted with an aketun (a padded jacket which went down to the knees) and chain mail. While not as impenetrable as plate mail, an aketun could stop sword blows and provided sufficient protection for the wearer.</p>
